# Issue Comment Guide

TrustBridge comments are designed to be actionable for contributors and auditable for maintainers.

## What the comment includes

- The checked Stellar account.
- The Horizon endpoint used for verification.
- The target asset code and issuer.
- Per-check status for funding, trustline readiness, and XLM reserve.
- Links to Stellar Laboratory and LOBSTR for remediation.

## Maintainer tips

If contributors are confused, ask them to compare the account and issuer shown in the comment with the wallet account they intended to use. Most failures come from unfunded accounts, wrong issuers, or missing Change Trust operations.
